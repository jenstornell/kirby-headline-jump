Field which makes it possible to jump between Kirby Panel headline groups.

## Background

### Problems with accordions / tabs

I've used accordions and tabs fields/plugins many times. They make a great overview, but they also hide stuff. In some cases it means that fields can be hard to find.

### Problems with the built in `headline` field

The built in `headline` field is good, it doesn't hide anything, but I miss the overview from the accordions and tabs fields/plugins.

I wanted a combination of them. Show everything, but with a good overview. This plugin creates an index of the headlines. Just click on one of them to go to a headline group.

**In the screenshot below I've clicked "Headline 2":**
